The Reflective Authentication Service is a dedicated microservice designed to handle all aspects of user authentication and authorization within your system. It's built with Node.js (Express.js) and integrates with a PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM.

Here's a breakdown of its key components and their roles:

Core Functionalities
User Management: This service manages the entire lifecycle of a user, from registration and login to email verification, password resets, and profile retrieval.
Secure Authentication: It uses modern security practices for password hashing (Argon2) and secure token-based authentication (JWTs with access and refresh tokens).
Authorization: It supports role-based access control to determine what actions a user is permitted to perform.
Architectural Components
Application Entry Point (app.ts):

This is the main Express application file.
It sets up the Express server, applies essential middleware like helmet (for security headers), cors (for cross-origin requests), express.json (for parsing JSON bodies), and morgan (for request logging).
It defines the base API route /api which then uses the central router from ./routes/index.ts.
Includes a /health endpoint for readiness checks.
Integrates the global error handling middleware.
Routes (routes/index.ts, routes/auth.routes.ts):

routes/index.ts acts as the central router for the Auth Service, mounting authRoutes under the /auth path (e.g., /api/auth/...).
routes/auth.routes.ts defines all the specific API endpoints related to authentication:
POST /api/auth/register: For new user registration.
POST /api/auth/login: For user authentication and token issuance.
POST /api/auth/refresh: To obtain a new access token using a refresh token.
GET /api/auth/me: To fetch the current authenticated user's profile (protected route).
POST /api/auth/logout: To invalidate refresh tokens and log out a user.
GET /api/auth/verify-email/:token: To verify a user's email address using a token.
POST /api/auth/forgot-password: To initiate a password reset process.
POST /api/auth/reset-password/:token: To set a new password using a reset token.
Controllers (controllers/auth.controller.ts):

These functions handle incoming HTTP requests from the routes.
They act as a thin layer, receiving request data, calling the appropriate business logic methods from auth.service.ts, and sending back HTTP responses.
For example, register extracts user data from the request body and calls authService.register().
Services (services/auth.service.ts):

This is where the core business logic of the authentication service resides.
It contains functions for:
register(): Handles user creation, password hashing, and generating email verification tokens.
login(): Authenticates users, generates access and refresh tokens, and manages token expiration.
refreshToken(): Issues new access tokens based on valid refresh tokens.
logout(): Invalidates refresh tokens.
verifyEmail(): Marks a user's email as verified.
forgotPassword(): Generates and logs (or sends in a real app) a password reset token.
resetPassword(): Allows a user to set a new password using a valid reset token.
It interacts directly with the database via Prisma and uses JWT and password utilities.
Database (database.ts, user.model.ts):

database.ts: Initializes the Prisma client, configured for logging database queries in development. It also includes a testConnection function to verify the database connection on startup.
user.model.ts: Defines TypeScript interfaces for user-related data, including CreateUserInput (for registration) and UserResponse (for safe user data returned in responses, excluding sensitive fields like passwords and tokens). It also provides a toUserResponse helper function to transform Prisma user objects into the UserResponse format.
Middleware:

middlewares/auth.middleware.ts:
authMiddleware: Verifies the JWT access token sent in the Authorization header. If valid, it decodes the token and attaches the user's information (id, email, role) to the Express Request object for subsequent route handlers.
authorize: An optional middleware for role-based access control, ensuring that only users with specific roles can access certain routes.
middlewares/error.middleware.ts: This is a global error handling middleware. It catches various types of errors (custom ApiError instances, Prisma errors, Joi validation errors, or any unexpected errors) and sends standardized JSON error responses to the client, while logging detailed errors internally.
middlewares/validation.middleware.ts: The validate middleware uses Joi schemas to validate incoming request bodies (e.g., for registration or login). If validation fails, it throws a ValidationError which is then caught by the errorMiddleware.
Utilities (utils folder):

catchAsync.ts: A higher-order function that wraps asynchronous Express route handlers, automatically catching any errors and passing them to the next middleware (specifically, errorMiddleware), eliminating the need for repetitive try-catch blocks in controllers.
errors.ts: Defines custom error classes (ApiError, NotFoundError, UnauthorizedError, ForbiddenError, ValidationError). These provide structured error messages and HTTP status codes for consistent API responses.
jwt.ts: Contains functions for generateJwt (to create new access/refresh tokens) and verifyJwt (to validate tokens). It retrieves the JWT_SECRET from environment variables.
logger.ts: Configures pino for efficient and structured logging, allowing you to control log levels based on the environment (e.g., debug in development, info in production).
password.ts: Provides utility functions for hashing user passwords using argon2 (a robust password hashing algorithm) and for verifying a provided password against a stored hash.
validation-schemas.ts: Defines Joi schemas (e.g., registerSchema, loginSchema) that specify the structure and validation rules for incoming request data.
Configuration (config/index.ts):

Manages environment variables critical for the Auth Service's operation, such as the NODE_ENV, PORT, JWT_SECRET, JWT expiry times (accessTokenExpiry, refreshTokenExpiry), whether email verification is required, and the LOG_LEVEL. It ensures that these variables are loaded from .env files.
Type Definitions (types/express.d.ts, types/index.ts):

types/express.d.ts: Extends the Express Request object to include a user property, which holds the decoded JWT payload after authentication middleware has run.
types/index.ts: Defines common TypeScript interfaces for JWT payloads, various request (e.g., RegisterRequest, LoginRequest) and response (e.g., AuthResponse, UserProfile) data structures used across the service.
In essence, your Auth Service is a self-contained, secure, and well-structured application responsible for managing user identities and access control. It leverages middleware for concerns like validation and error handling, keeps business logic separate in services, and uses a database for persistence, making it robust and scalable.
